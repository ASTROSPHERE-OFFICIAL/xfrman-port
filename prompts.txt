Create a website with a futuristic outer space or astronaut technology theme. Use red, purple, and yellow neon colors as the main color scheme. Apply a glowing neon effect throughout the design for a high-tech atmosphere.  The background must be an animated tech-inspired scene, such as moving star constellations, flowing particles, or space elements that subtly move across the screen to give a sense of dynamic motion.  At the top of the homepage or dashboard, display the title "XFrmannV" in a bold, glowing style using the Inter font from Google Fonts.  About Me: My name is XFrmanJS, the owner of Astrospace.
